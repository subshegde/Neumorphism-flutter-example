Welcome to the Neumorphism Music Player UI project! In this project, I explored the Neumorphism design trend in Flutter by creating a sleek and modern music player UI with a unique, soft, and visually appealing look.

This project showcases how Neumorphism can be used to create intuitive and interactive user interfaces, blending both depth and aesthetics.
